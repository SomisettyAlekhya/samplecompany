    <h2 class="hjj">Helium Gas Balloons</h2>
    <h2 class="hj" id="pppo"><img src="D:\xampp\htdocs\practice\project10\helium.jpg"></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>A gas balloon is a balloon that rises and floats in the air because it is filled with a gas lighter than air (such as helium or hydrogen).</li>
        <li> When not in flight, it is tethered to prevent it from flying away and is sealed at the bottom to prevent the escape of gas.</li>
    </ul>
